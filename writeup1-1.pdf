Team Members: Piper Feldman and Shaina Bagri
We used Python to develop since Shaina has experience using the pandas package in Python from her data science class.
Piper had experience using the Visual Studio Code Liveshare, so we developed in a VS Code environment. We also used GitHub
and git to facilitate collaboration on the code development.
We decided to split up each command into a separate function to make the code more readable and easier to debug. We primarily
used the dataframe structure that comes with the pandas package. This structure allowed us to easily parse the csv file into a 
database structure.
